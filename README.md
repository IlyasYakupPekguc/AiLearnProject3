1----------------------------------------- THE GOAL EXPLAINED IN DETAILS:

First of all i'm a second grade student at Gazi University. I want to see what ai is about and learn more about the subject. This is my official Fourth project about ai. My first experience was within a compition named Teknofest. Agter gaining interest in AI i'm willing to learn more about this topic and i think the best way to do that is through projects. So this is my Third YouTube based project. While learning i also intend to get a fuller GitHub page. So that's a double win-win. After finishing the project i intend to continue the YouTube playlist if it apeals to me and my goals.
